Hi world! I just finished hosting this website in an AWS S3 bucket. It's cool for me to host this website here since I'm studying for my _AWS Solutions Architect_ certification, so I'm getting my hands dirty a little bit. My DNS is a little funky right now, but I _think_ I fixed them and I'm just waiting for the new settings to propagate throughout the internet. 

My goal for this blog is to document my life a little bit, share my thoughts and feelings, document some cool projects, and practice some coding skills. As time passes, I hope to have a neat little website that I can share with the world!

I'm using a framework called [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to run this blog. It supports a language called [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started), which seems like a good way of making nicely formatted notes. My blog posts will be coded using markdown so I can practice it a bit more.

I'm also a musician, so I'll certainly be posting things about my musicial endeavors as well!
